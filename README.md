# BOOKHISTORY

Web front-end in Angular with a backend component that displays the history of changes of book entities with pagination, filtering, ordering and optionally grouping.

The book entity has 
•	An id
•	A title
•	A short description
•	Publish date
•	Authors

An example of changes could be a title was changed, an author was added, etc. It should also be possible to add books.
In the list of changes it should display at least the time of change and a description of what was changed (e.g. Title was changed to “The Hobbit”)
Type of storage used is firebase realtime database

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
